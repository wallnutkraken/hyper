# hyper

A web daemon for redirecting URLs to unique short URLs.

# Why?

Links created with `hyper` can be mutated if needed. This is useful for when the links become broken. If this happens,
`hyper` can change the destinations, without the user having to change the `hyper` URLs used elsewhere.

Convenience.
